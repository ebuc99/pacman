Pacman
------

This is a clone of the original pacman from Namco, as I remember , and I played 
for the first time on an Atari 130 XL in the early 90s.
But Paul Neaves pacman clone has inspired me greatly.
One of the main goals of this implementation is a SDL Application with very
less use of CPU power.
